          A background in theater and music performance, Brendan uses his
          artistic training to influence his compositions & sound designs. He
          prides himself on offering many of the same services found in
          professional sound studios at flexible rates, especially for up and
          coming artists and creatives. When he isnâ€™t mixing, he is spends his
          time watching any NBA game he can catch, checking out the latest
          hip-hop mixes, and patiently waiting for the Cleveland Browns to be in
          the 2021 Super Bowl.
